```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Install the tidyverse package and load the tidyverse: 
  Note, you can install packages directly in the console
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

health_full <- read_csv("https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/swc5-untb/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD&bom=true&format=true")

head(health_full)

```


what do you want to write, and where do you want to write it to? 
```{r}
write_csv(health_full, "health_full.csv")
health_full_again <- read_csv("health_full.csv")

#this helps you remove the data set, it's great if your environment gets too crowded 
rm(health_full_again)

```

```{r}

```

















## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
